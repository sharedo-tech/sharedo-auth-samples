# Client credentials samples

This folder contains samples for various languages that will utilise the oAuth client credentials flow (and impersonation extensions).

The client credentials flow is designed for app to app integrations between semi-trusted services. It should never be used in client applications such as javascript SPAs, mobile apps, or other web apps where a secret cannot be kept.
